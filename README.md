# FLDetector
The official code of KDD22 paper "FLDetecotor: Defending Federated Learning Against Model Poisoning Attacks via Detecting Malicious Clients" [[paper]](http://home.ustc.edu.cn/~zaixi/ZaixiZhang_files/FLDetector.pdf).

Our implementation is based on [[MXNet]](https://mxnet.apache.org/versions/1.9.1/).

Use train_mnist.py, train_cifar.py, and train_femnist.py to implement FLDetector on MNIST, CIFAR10, and FEMNIST.
